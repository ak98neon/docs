<Warning>Use this block to introduce pauses in your workflow execution.</Warning>

## Delay

### Description:
Pauses the workflow for a specified duration before continuing to the next block.

Key Parameters:

> **data.action** - `"delay"`, indicating that the block introduces a time delay.

> **params.delay** - The duration of the delay.

> **params.timeUnit** - The unit of time (e.g., `"Seconds"`, `"Minutes"`).

Connections:

- **Input:** Accepts the preceding node's execution.
- **Output:** Passes execution to the next node after the specified delay.

Use Cases:

- Adding a wait time before executing the next step.
- Throttling API calls to prevent exceeding rate limits.

### Code Example

1. **block_id** - Unique identifier for the Delay block.
2. **connected_block_id** - Unique identifier for the next block after the delay.
